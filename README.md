# ml_api

## Getting started

We'll use `conda` for environment management in this project. If you don't have it installed, I recommend
using the [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution.

Create a new virtual environment with required packages by running:
`conda env create -f conda_env.yml`
